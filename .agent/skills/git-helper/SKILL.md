# Git Helper Skill
This skill assists in managing the project's version control efficiently.

## Instructions
- Always check the current branch state before making significant changes.
- Write clear, concise, and descriptive commit messages (e.g., "feat: add deck inventory script").
- Use branches for new features and bug fixes to keep the main history clean.
- Provide clear instructions on how to resolve merge conflicts or revert changes if issues arise.
- Ensure `.gitignore` is up to date and excludes unnecessary files like `.venv` or `__pycache__`.
