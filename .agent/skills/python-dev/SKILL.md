# Python Development Skill
This skill helps maintain clean, efficient, and well-documented Python code.

## Instructions
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines for all Python code.
- Use type hints wherever possible to improve readability and tooling support.
- Ensure all functions and classes have descriptive docstrings (Google or NumPy style).
- Use virtual environments properly and maintain an accurate `requirements.txt`.
- Prioritize modularity and avoid overly complex functions (follow DRY and SOLID principles).
- When refactoring, ensure that backward compatibility is maintained unless explicitly asked otherwise.
