# Python Refactoring Skill
This skill focuses on transforming Python code into its most "Pythonic" and maintainable form.

## Instructions
- Identify and simplify complex nested logic (reduce cyclomatic complexity).
- Apply "friendly-python" patterns: prioritize readability and maintainability over extreme brevity.
- Refactor legacy code to use modern Python features (e.g., match-case, walrus operator, f-strings).
- Ensure security best practices (e.g., avoiding `eval`, sanitizing inputs).
- Extract reusable logic into utility functions or decorators to minimize duplication.
- Improve testability by decoupling dependencies.
