# UI Styling Skill
This skill deepens the agent's ability to create and audit complex user interfaces.

## Instructions
- Use component composition patterns to keep UI code modular (e.g., separating layout from logic).
- Audit for accessibility (ARIA labels, color contrast) and responsiveness.
- Prioritize high-quality, distinctive frontend interfaces that match the "premium" aesthetic.
- When refactoring UI components, eliminate "prop drilling" by using context or better composition.
- Follow a consistent design system for spacing, shadows, and interaction states (hover, active, disabled).
