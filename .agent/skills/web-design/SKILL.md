# Web Design Skill
This skill ensures all UI components follow modern design principles, consistent with the user's high aesthetic standards.

## Instructions
- Prioritize visual excellence: use curated color palettes, smooth gradients, and modern typography (e.g., Inter, Outfit).
- Use dynamic design: implement hover effects, micro-animations, and responsive layouts.
- Avoid generic styles: no plain red/blue/green. Use HSL-tailored colors and sleek dark modes.
- Implement glassmorphism and subtle shadows for a premium feel.
- Ensure unique IDs for all interactive elements to facilitate testing.
